    <h1>Q1 > WHAT IS COMPUTER HARDWARE?</h1>

        Ans - A simple definition of computer hardware is “any physical parts or components that contribute to a computer system.” 
        There are several different kinds of hardware inside a PC. Both desktop and laptop PCs include these types of hardware,
         though the size and type differ because of a laptop’s compact design. <br>  <hr>    
 <div>
                               <h3> ********** COMPUTER HARDWARE COMPONENTS ***********</h3>
    1. Motherboard
    2. central processing unit(UPU) ,
    3. Randam access memory  (RAM)
    4.Storage drive (HHD or SSD) 
    5. Central Processing Unit (CPU) , 
    6. keybord , 
    7.mouse,
    8.monitor,

    <h4>1. What is a motherboard?</h4>
     ANSWER - Your computer’s motherboard is the hub that connects all the other pieces of computer hardware,
     acting as the brain to allocate and coordinate power across all other components.

<h4>2. What is a central processing unit (CPU)?</h4>
ANSWER - CPU stands for central processing unit, and it’s responsible for guiding your computer as it processes data,
 much like a brain guides a body. The speed at which is does this is known as ‘clock speed’, and is measured in gigahertz (GHz).
 A CPU advertising a high GHz rating will  likely perform faster than others from the same brand and generation.

 <H4>3. What is random access memory (RAM)?</H4>
 Answer - Computer RAM  works closely with the CPU and temporarily stores information created by programs so that 
 it's immediately accessible. It’s sometimes referred to as ‘volatile’ memory because this data gets erased every time your computer restarts. <br>

   <h4>Example</h4>
 (a) You have many tabs open in your browser <br>
 (b)- the data for each tab is in RAM aprogram is running  <br>
 (c)- the code of the program is in RAM a program is manipulating a large image <br>
 (d)- the data of the image is in RAM
 
<h4> 4.Storage drive (HHD or SSD) </h4>
Answer - The primary data storage device of a computer is the HDD.
 The hardware component stores software titles, operating systems, and files. 

 <h4> 5. Central Processing Unit (CPU) </h4>
 Answer - A CPU is the hardware responsible for processing all the information from the programs run by a computer. 
 Gigahertz (GHz) is used to measure the speed at which a CPU processes information. 
  <h4> 6. keybord</h4>
  Answer - Like a type-writer, a keyboard allows a user to interact with the system. It is an input device used to input characters, text and commands. 

  <h4> 7.mouse</h4>
   Answer -The hand-held pointing device used to navigate through the screen is a computer mouse. A typical mouse uses optical sensors to direct the cursor.

<h4> 8.monitor</h4>
Answer - This familiar component is the hardware that displays video or graphical information of the computer. These are also termed video display units <br>

 <h1> 2. > what is computer software</h1>
In a computer system, the software is basically a set of instructions or commands that tell a computer what to do.
In other words, the software is a computer program that provides a set of instructions to execute a user’s commands and tell the computer what to do. For example like MS-Word, MS-Excel, PowerPoint, etc. <hr>
 <h2>. Types of Software</h2>
 1. System Software, 2. Application Software
 <h3> . System Software</h3>
 <p>System software is software that directly operates the computer hardware and provides the basic functionality to the users as well as to the other software to operate smoothly. Or in other words, system software basically controls a computer’s internal functioning and also controls hardware devices such as monitors, printers, and storage devices, etc. It is like an interface between hardware and user applications, it helps them to communicate with each other because hardware understands machine language(i.e. 1 or 0) whereas user applications are work in human-readable languages like English, Hindi, German, etc. so system software converts the human-readable language into machine language and vice versa</p>
 <h3>. Application Software </h3>
 <p>Software that performs special functions or provides functions that are much more than the basic operation of the computer is known as application software. Or in other words, application software is designed to perform a specific task for end-users. It is a product or a program that is designed only to fulfill end-users’ requirements. It includes word processors, spreadsheets, database management, inventory, payroll programs, etc.</p>
    
 <h5>What is an example of Software</h5>
 You need software in order for the computer to operate effectively. It is a collection of data that is given to the computer to complete a particular task. three main categories of software are application software, programming software, and system software. All these three are important for the particular task to be performed. <br>

(a) Management Tools <br>
(b)  Compression Tools <br>
(c)  Internet Explorer <br>
(d)  ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning) <br>
(e) BI (Business Intelligence) <br>
(f) Customer Support Systems <br>

<h1>3.> explain javascript history </h1>
<p>. JavaScript is everywhere, and for the seventh year in a row, it has been ranked the most commonly used programming language, with 67.8% of developers employing it in 2019. Its ascent to the world’s most popular programming language is synonymous with the rise of the internet itself. <br> <hr>

. Created out of necessity, it is used to build 95.2% (1.52 billion) of websites today, including some of the world’s largest, like Facebook and YouTube. Without it, we would not have popular and useful web apps such as Google Maps and eBay.  <br> <hr>
    
. So, without further ado, let’s take a look at what JavaScript is,  how and why it was created, and what’s next for the language.</p> <hr>

<h1>4.> Differnce between input and output device </h1>
<h3>input </h3>
(a) Input devices are the component of the computer system that accepts incoming data and instructions and converts them into a pattern of electrical signals in binary code that is understandable to a digital computer.
Example: Keyboard, mouse etc.

(b) Keyboard and Mouse:= -These are the input devices that are used by the users to give input to the computer. They send the received input (Data) from users to the system. As these are input devices, they cannot receive or display output (information) from the computer. <br> <hr>
(c) Microphone =: Another input device is a microphone that accepts sound generated by an input source and allows users to send audio into their computers. In the microphone, the accepted signal may be converted into a digital signal or can be amplified as an analog signal. <br> <hr>
(c) Webcam:  =  A webcam is a video camera that connects to a computer and faces the user, which is used to capture pictures, make a video by a computer system. It takes images as input from where it is pointed and used for calling and taking selfies. However, most modern webcams have a microphone, which offers users a better sound quality while making videos. Webcams are attached to the monitor of a desktop computer and also built into laptops. <hr> 
<h3>output</h3>
(b)Output devices are the component of computer system that converts the digitized signals into a form understandable to the user. The output devices are generally known as reverse of input devices. Output devices also send data from one computer system to another.
example: Monitor, printer etc.

(a) Monitor: A monitor is a piece of computer hardware that accepts data from a computer (output) and displays it on the system screen through the computer's video card. Monitors have the ability to display information at a much higher resolution. Additionally, these are much like televisions and also known as video screen, display, video display terminal, or video display unit. <hr>
(b) Speakers: The most common output devices, speakers accept sound data from a computer and play the sounds for users to hear. Although speakers can be used with any type of sound system, some speakers are manufactured only for computers. It is a device that cannot receive sound generated by users as well as refer that sound to another device. The main objective of the speakers is to produce sound or audio output for the listener. <hr>
(c) Projector: A projector is an output device that accepts data from a computer (output) and projects that data or information as a picture onto a wall or screen or any large surface. It does not have the ability to receive data from a user and also not capable of sending that data to another device. When you are showing video or images to a large group of people, a projector is more beneficial to use instead of a monitor because it displays data on a large surface that can be visible to a large number of people clearly. <hr>

<h1>5.> What is an interface</h1>

<p>In general, an interface is a device or a system that unrelated entities use to interact. According to this definition, a remote control is an interface between you and a television set, the English language is an interface between two people, and the protocol of behavior enforced in the military is the interface between people of different ranks. <hr>
   (a) Within the Java programming language, an interface (in the glossary) is a type, just as a class is a type. Like a class, an interface defines methods. Unlike a class, an interface never implements methods; instead, classes that implement the interface implement the methods defined by the interface. A class can implement multiple interfaces.
    <hr>
    (b) The bicycle class and its class hierarchy define what a bicycle can and cannot do in terms of its "bicycleness." But bicycles interact with the world on other terms. For example, a bicycle in a store could be managed by an inventory program. An inventory program doesn’t care what class of items it manages, as long as each item provides certain information, such as price and tracking number. Instead of forcing class relationships on otherwise unrelated items, the inventory program sets up a protocol of communication. This protocol comes in the form of a set of method definitions contained within an interface. The inventory interface would define, but not implement, methods that set and get the retail price, assign a tracking number, and so on. <hr>
    
   (c) To work in the inventory program, the bicycle class must agree to this protocol by implementing the interface. When a class implements an interface, the class agrees to implement all the methods defined in the interface. Thus, the bicycle class would provide the implementations for the methods that set and get retail price, assign a tracking number, and so on. <hr>
    
   (d) You use an interface to define a protocol of behavior that can be implemented by any class anywhere in the class hierarchy. Interfaces are useful for the following: <hr>
    
  (e)  Capturing similarities among unrelated classes without artificially forcing a class relationship
    Declaring methods that one or more classes are expected to implement
    Revealing an object's programming interface without revealing its class
    Modelling multiple inheritance, a feature that some object-oriented languages support that allows a class to have more than one superclass</p>
